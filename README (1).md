# 🧠 AI-Powered Document & Web Content QA Agent using Langflow + Astra DB

## 1. 🎯 Aim of the Project
The goal of this project is to create a robust, scalable Question-Answering (QA) agent that can ingest structured documents (CSVs, PDFs) and unstructured web content, store them in a vector store, and allow users to query and interact with the data using natural language. This acts as a smart assistant capable of understanding domain-specific content and responding intelligently.

---

## 2. 📄 Project Description
This medium-level Langflow-based project combines various tools and components to:
- Upload files and extract content.
- Parse and chunk the content using Langflow’s text-processing nodes.
- Store and retrieve data from Astra DB (Vector DB).
- Build conversational agents using Google Generative AI and Groq LLMs.
- Enable web scraping via the URL component for external data fetch.
- Deliver real-time chat-based output using a connected frontend.

The architecture supports integration via MCP (Model Context Protocol) for production use and third-party tool embedding.

## 3. 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Langflow** | A powerful visual programming tool to build AI pipelines and agents. Used for flow orchestration. |
| **Astra DB by DataStax** | Used as a scalable vector store to store document embeddings and support semantic search. |
| **Google Generative AI (Gemini)** | For text generation and intelligent QA with natural language prompts. |
| **Groq LLM (Deepseek LLaMA)** | Lightweight, fast-response language model used inside agent components for document-based querying. |
| **URL Content Fetcher** | Extracts and parses website data recursively for broader content reach. |
| **Parser + Split Text** | Parses raw files and breaks them into manageable chunks for embedding. |
| **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** | Exposes Langflow flows as tools that can be called by other agents or clients. |
| **Playground + Chat Output** | For testing and deploying the final agent pipeline interactively. |

## 4. 🔄 Flow Description

### 🔹 Flow 1: Document QA Flow
1. **File Component** → Loads CSV or PDF files.
2. **Split Text Node** → Chunks the document with custom chunk size and overlap.
3. **Astra DB Vector Store** → Ingests the chunks and stores embeddings.
4. **Parser** → Converts the retrieved content into a readable format.
5. **Prompt Template** → Dynamically constructs prompts using parsed data and user queries.
6. **Google Generative AI Node** → Generates human-like responses based on the prompt.
7. **Chat Output** → Displays final answers to the user in real-time.

### 🔹 Flow 2: Agent-Based Multitool Flow
1. **File Component + URL Fetcher** → Fetches both static files and web content.
2. **Parser** → Formats the data.
3. **Prompt** → Feeds document content into agent.
4. **Agent Component (Groq)** → Equipped with instructions, calculator, and toolset logic to answer based on input and context.
5. **Chat Output** → Response is displayed to user.

This modular design ensures each component plays a specific role—from ingestion to answer generation.

## 5. 📌 Inference & Conclusion
This Langflow-based QA system demonstrates the ability to:
- Seamlessly blend document storage, retrieval, and NLP-based QA.
- Scale using multiple tools via vector stores and agents.
- Create extensible pipelines for different content formats (CSV, PDF, URLs).
- Support low-latency, real-time responses suitable for enterprise deployment.

With MCP integration and embedding options, this system is ready for internal use, client exposure, or SaaS delivery.

## 6. 🔮 Future Enhancements

Here are some ways to elevate this project to an industry-level product:

1. **Multilingual Support** → Add translation and support for multilingual input and answers.
2. **Summarization Node** → Add summary generation to provide quick insights from documents.
3. **User Upload Interface** → Build a frontend allowing users to upload documents and ask questions.
4. **Context-Aware Multi-Agent Pipeline** → Use chained agents for topic classification and question routing.
5. **Fine-Tuned LLM Integration** → Integrate fine-tuned models for legal, finance, or medical domains.
6. **Role-Based Access Control** → Restrict which users can upload or query which datasets.
7. **Metadata Tagging** → Allow querying based on metadata filters (date, source, type).

## 7. 📝 Notes

### 🔍 Context Explanation (in simplified terms):

- **PDF Handling Issue**: Uploading a large multi-page PDF exceeded the token/quota limit, resulting in failure. Switching to a smaller file fixed the issue. This highlights the importance of preprocessing or chunking larger files before inference.

- **Astra DB as Multi-Source Retriever**: A single agent can retrieve from up to 5 Astra DB vector sources. Give each retriever a distinct name like `FinanceRetriever` to reduce confusion and latency.

- **Scalability Tip**: For larger projects, merge all datasets into a single Astra DB instance using either namespaces or custom document metadata (e.g., `"source": "products.csv"`).

- **URL Component Use**: The `URL` component can crawl ecommerce sites or public blogs to retrieve data, opening possibilities for news summaries, product comparisons, etc.

- **Langflow Templates**: Use prebuilt flow templates to fast-track development for use cases like chatbots, RAG pipelines, or structured summarization.

- **Sharing & Embedding**: Langflow flows can be shared publicly or embedded in your website using the provided embed script (`<langflow-chat>`), enabling seamless client demos.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/logspace-ai/langflow-embedded-chat@v1.0.7/dist/build/static/js/bundle.min.js"></script>

<langflow-chat
  window_title="Basic Prompting"
  flow_id="your-flow-id"
  host_url="http://localhost:7860"
></langflow-chat>
```

- **MCP Server Support**: Langflow can serve as an MCP server exposing flows as tools callable by other applications. This turns Langflow from a UI-only playground into an API-first agent backend.
